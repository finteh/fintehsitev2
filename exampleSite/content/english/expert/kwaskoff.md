In 2017, he spoke on the topic of Digital immortality in Skolkovo at the Open Innovations Forum https://www.facebook.com/kwaskoff/videos/1555430671172975/

Then he held a personal open lecture at Moscow State University on the topic "Bloody Blockchain".

At the end of the same year, he was one of the founders and was elected president of the non-governmental organization Financial Technologies Association https://finteh.t.me , which already has 730 people from the field of financial technology.
In 2019, the association created a web3 incubator (crypto accelerator?)  for fintech projects with open source and free licenses - fincubator. The incubator is managed by the association's pool of experts.

He was invited to various TV shows (Russian languages)
1. NANO TV Channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8cz58X4fm4
2. Radio Liberty https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKJUlXfNUNk
3. Mediametrics  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW-WBOtNWi0

He spoke at the Alpha future people forum  (Russian) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BstYchIGN-M

In 2018 , he became an investment manager of a cryptocurrency fund Golos.io Fund.

In the same year, he conducted in Moscow the only practical experiment in Russia on the study of unconditional basic income (UBI).
The project was discussed with employees of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and received a written review.

Most of my personal time is spent studying new projects and approaches in web3. The ideas of private finance and neobanking are being publicly promoted. Together with other experts of the association, private investors, fintech companies and startups are consulted. Audits are conducted and expert opinions are issued.
